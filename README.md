# Clinic-System
I am responsible for developing and managing the backend of the Clinic System mobile application using ASP.NET API. My role involves designing and implementing RESTful API endpoints that interact with the database to manage clinic operations, such as patient records, appointment scheduling, medical history, and billing information.
